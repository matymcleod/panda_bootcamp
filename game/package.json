Create a Mage class, with a constructor that takes a name. Set this.name to name in the constructor. Export the class from the file. 3) Create a game.js Import the Mage class using require, and create a new Mage with whatever name you want. Log it to the console. 4) Do the same thing for 7 classes total: Warrior, Shaman, Warlock, Paladin, Mage, Gambler, and Medic. making sure your game.js uses all 7 files to create one (or more!) of each class. 5) Create a pet.js file. Create a Pet class, with a constructor that types one parameter, name. Export Pet from the file. 6) in Warlock and then Shaman, import the Pet class, and in the constructor function, set this.pets to an empty array. Then, create a new Pet, then push it to the array. These classes start with a pet when they are made!  Next lesson is Sunday, was going to do tomorrow but this gives some people time to catch up too and practice previous for loops and shit",
