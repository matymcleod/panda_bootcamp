4) Create a fun game loop! The world is your oyster.
BARE MINIMUM:
- ~Choose a class, instantiate your character based on that class. Throw an error if that class is not available.~
  - 1st prompt: choose a character(new character class gets created)


- Select random mobs to fight, in a "turn based" fighting system.
  - 2nd prompt: choose which mob to fight(selectable via number)
  - 

  
- Offer the ability to attack, equip weapon, summon pet, or cast a spell each turn.
  - 3rd prompt: choose what to fight with or defend (selectible via number)
  - Character then gets hit by selected mob


- Level up after a mob is defeated, or game over if you are defeated.
  - Need to keep track of each mobs health(if badguy.health && buttface.health && dudaroo.health <= 0)
  - Once all mobs health is equal to or less than zero

- IF you defeat all mobs, you win!
